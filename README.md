# Encryption-Decryption
A project from Hyperskill (Project: Encryption-Decryption) implemented in F#. This is a test project, used as learning experience for the F# language.

[Here is the project's reference](https://hyperskill.org/projects/46)

Implemented features:

1. Hardcoded encryption of the string "we found a treasure!"
2. Encryption using the Caesar's cipher, with user input (for both the text to encrypt, and the key)
3. Decryption using the Caesar's cipher, with user input (for both the text to decrypt, and the key)
4. Ecryption of an entire file, and saving the encrypted text to another file (user provides both files' names)

## I didn't really feel like more features are needed, as this language works the same way as other .NET languages. I only wanted to get myself familiar with the syntax.
